# PKS coding test
Patient data from laboratory are exported into CSV file. One line in CSV file represents one attribute with four fields - date, patientId, attribute name and attribute value. 

Attribute and their values are grouped into episodes. An episode is a group of all attributes for one patient on a single day.

```

Your task is to provide an implementation to:
 * read data from the CSV file.
 * print number of female patients.
 * print number of male patients.
 * print average age of male patients.
 * print average age of female patients.

When considering your design, bear in mind that that your product manager plans to add more functionality to the system like:
 * finding all patients with increasing Glucose levels,
 * printing a report of average blood pressure for patients in a specified age range,
 * etc
 
Please document any assumptions you make.
